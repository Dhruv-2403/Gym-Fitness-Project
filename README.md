# ⚙️ Setup and Run Instructions (Local Environment)

1.**Backend Setup (Node.js + Express + Prisma)**

- Clone the Repository
- Download or clone the project repository from GitHub to your local system.

- Open the Backend Folder
- Go into the backend directory of the project.

- Install Dependencies(npm install)
- Install all the required Node.js packages listed in the package.json file. This step ensures that Express, Prisma, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, dotenv, and other libraries are available.

- Create an Environment File
- Inside the backend folder, create a .env file.This file stores sensitive configuration details like your database connection URL, JWT secret key, and port number.
- Set Up the Database
  Use Prisma commands to initialize your database tables and models.(npx prisma migrate dev and then npx prisma generate)
  Make sure your database is running locally.


- Start the Backend Server(node index.js/npm run dev)
Run the backend server.
Once started, it will usually be available at http://localhost:3000.

- Test the API
Open Postman or any API testing tool.
You can test endpoints like:

- Signup (to create a new user)

- Login (to get a JWT token)

- Profile (to fetch user details using the token)

2. **Frontend Setup (ReactJS + Vite+ Tailwind CSS)**

- Go to the Frontend Folder
Navigate to the frontend directory of your project.

- Install Dependencies
Install all required frontend libraries (React, Tailwind, etc.) listed in the frontend’s package.json.

- Start the Frontend Application
Run the frontend server.


- Connect Frontend with Backend
The frontend will automatically communicate with the backend running at http://localhost:3000.
Make sure both servers (frontend and backend) are running at the same time.

# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Project Title: Gym & Fitness Platform


# üß© **Problem Statement**
*Managing user authentication securely in a fitness platform is often complex.
Most small-scale fitness dashboards lack proper backend infrastructure for:*

- *Secure user registration and login*

- *Protected profile access*

- *Token-based authentication*

- *Safe password storage (without any DB leaks or exposing sensitive data)*
  
# üí° **Proposed Solution**
*To solve this, we developed a secure and modular backend system using Node.js, Express, and Prisma ORM.
Our solution provides:*

- *Secure user signup and login with password hashing (bcryptjs)*

- *JWT-based authentication for sessionless, scalable access control*

- *Middleware protection for private routes (like user profiles authMiddleware)*

- *Environment-based configuration for flexible deployment*

- *Structured codebase following modern REST API standards*
